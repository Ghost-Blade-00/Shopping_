💻 Technical Specifications
1. State Management: Implements React useState hooks to manage global cart state and search filtering logic across a non-relational product array.

2. Dynamic Routing: Utilizes react-router-dom for parameter-based navigation, enabling a single SearchResults component to handle multiple category endpoints.

3. UI Framework: Built with MUI (Material UI) v6, leveraging a customized createTheme engine for consistent typography and spacing across the DOM.

4. Performance Optimization: Employs CSS-in-JS via MUI’s sx prop for scoped styling and Grid v2 for optimized layout rendering.

5. Currency Logic: Executes toLocaleString methods to parse integer price values into Indian Standard format directly within the UI layer.
   
6. Dynamic Theme: Toggle between high-contrast Dark and Light modes
